# this file defines nested entities that should be joined to main entity when requesting it with /item/:type/:id

# 'item' property allows us to define different routes for same entities e.g. "League" and "League_full"

# joins define ids that should be joined from indexes. Key is child model name. value is parent model name. Team: League means "all teams by this league"
# pay attention to order when working with nested entities. E.g. you should define  Game:League before declaring GameEvent:Game. Otherwise, games ids array will be empty

# do not define one-to-one joins, they will be added automatically. This config is for list joins only.
